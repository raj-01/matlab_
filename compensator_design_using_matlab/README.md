In this we first obtained the motor transfer fucntion by getting the real time sampling data of angular velocity vs number of samples.

We proximated the motor to be of first order.

Using the motor transfer fuction we checked its step responce.

Now we deriverd the compansator transfer fucntion for requred values of settling time and peek overshoot.

we than first simulated the step responce to the motor transfer fucntion with compensator.

Then we applied that compensator to the motor in real time.

And then we varified the result obtained from  simulation with the real time implementation on motor.
